This is a very experimental database connection pooling implementation for Django

Usage is simple. When you have currently this in settings.py:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': ...,
    },
    ...
}
alter it to:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_pooled',
        'NAME': ...,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'WRAPS': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        }
    },
    ...
}

Does it work? Not really. There are some problems:
  - Django doesn't offer any nice way for separating taking connections from initializing
    the state of the connection. This is all done in ._cursor(). Due to this, if the settings
    change -> you are screwed. This isn't really a problem in normal usage, but prevents
    running the Django's test suite.
